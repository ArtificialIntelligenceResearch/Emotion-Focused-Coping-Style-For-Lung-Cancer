### Example of Detailed Documentation: Model Architecture

#### docs/model_architecture.md


# Model Architecture

This document provides a detailed description of the machine learning models used in the Emotion-Focused Coping Style For Lung Cancer project.

## Overview

We employ several machine learning models to analyze the emotion-focused coping styles of lung cancer patients. The models include:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Random Forest
4. Gradient Boosting
5. Neural Networks

## Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a linear model used for binary classification problems. It calculates the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class.

### Implementation

The logistic regression model is implemented using `scikit-learn`'s `LogisticRegression` class.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Initialize the model
log_reg = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model
log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = log_reg.predict(X_test)
```

## Support Vector Machine (SVM)

SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.

### Implementation

The SVM model is implemented using `scikit-learn`'s `SVC` class.

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Initialize the model
svm = SVC()

# Train the model
svm.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = svm.predict(X_test)
```

## Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

### Implementation

The Random Forest model is implemented using `scikit-learn`'s `RandomForestClassifier` class.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Initialize the model
rf = RandomForestClassifier()

# Train the model
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = rf.predict(X_test)
```

## Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting is another ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, with each new model attempting to correct the errors made by the previous models.

### Implementation

The Gradient Boosting model is implemented using `scikit-learn`'s `GradientBoostingClassifier` class.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

# Initialize the model
gb = GradientBoostingClassifier()

# Train the model
gb.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = gb.predict(X_test)
```

## Neural Networks

Neural Networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, designed to recognize patterns.

### Implementation

The Neural Network model is implemented using `TensorFlow`'s `Keras` API.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Initialize the model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Conclusion

Each of these models provides unique advantages and can be used based on the specific requirements of the analysis. The choice of model depends on factors such as the nature of the data, the importance of interpretability, and computational resources available.
